# Linear Regression Model with Gradient Descent

A linear regression model for predicting house prices using gradient descent, implemented with Scikit-learn.

## Description

This project provides an implementation of linear regression using gradient descent to predict housing prices. It includes both Scikit-learn and from-scratch implementations.

## Files

- `gradient_descent.ipynb`: Scikit-learn implementation.
- `gradient_descent_from_scratch.ipynb`: Gradient descent from scratch.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aifia105/linear-regression-model-gradient-descent.git
